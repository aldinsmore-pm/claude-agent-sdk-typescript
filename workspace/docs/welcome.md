# Welcome to Workspace

Workspace is your doc-first assistant. Everything you see in the Notebook is a document the agent can read and update.

## Get started in 2 minutes

1. Read the sample docs in the sidebar to understand the context.
2. Ask for a work product in **Ask / Generate** (try one of the prompts below).
3. Watch the run timeline and review the saved brief when it appears.

## Try these prompts

- Summarize these notes into a client brief.
- Turn the research notes into key points and next actions.
- Draft a weekly update for leadership.

## What to expect

- The agent saves output as real documents in this workspace.
- You can create, rename, delete, and search documents any time.
- The output follows a consistent brief template so it is ready to share.
